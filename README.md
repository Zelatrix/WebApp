This JavaScript project takes an initial distance (how far the user wants to travel), and as the journey progresses, repeatedly calculates how far is left until the user has travelled their desired distance, updating the screen with the remaining distance. When the user has reached the end of their journey, a message confirming the journey's end is displayed.
